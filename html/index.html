                <p class="card-text">Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in São Pedro, Funchal, on the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in Santo António, Funchal.
                   He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man.
                    He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia".
                      His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure.
                       Ronaldo grew up in a Catholic and impoverished home, sharing a room with all his siblings.

                  As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with Nacional.
                   In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.
                    He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting youth football academy.
                     By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally, and agreed with his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on football.
                  
                       However, one year later, he was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.
                        Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.
                         He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.</p>

              <h4>Manchester United</h4>
              <p>Ronaldo became Manchester United's first Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season. 
                His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.
                Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona, and David Beckham.
                Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.

              <h4>Ballon D'Or</h4>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo has won five Ballon d’Or till date.
                Ronaldo won his first Ballon d’Or in 2008 when he was still playing for Manchester United.
                He was also voted the club’s player of the year that season and helped them to win three successive league titles between 2007 and 2009.
                Manchester United remain the all-time leaders in number of English top flight wins, having taken home the trophy 20 times.
                Ronaldo subsequently won four Ballon d’Or trophies during his time at Real Madrid, where he won the Spanish league twice and the Champions League four times.
                Real Madrid dominated the Champions League in recent years and took home the trophy four out of five times between 2013 and 2018.
                They are by far the most successful team in European Cup history, having lifted the prestigious trophy a total of 13 times.
